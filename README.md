Dear Trilogy evaluator,


## Actions completed

Using the Bootstrap CSS Framework, I have created a mobile responsive portfolio.

* Created the following files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html`, `contact.html`, 'CSS' folder containing 'style.css' file, 'Images' folder containing jpg files and README file.

* Portfolio site has the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images


### Requirements achieved

* Functional, deployed application through using the Bootstrap's grid system

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar is consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page contains working links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* Semantic html has been used.

* Each page has valid and correct HTML. (used an HTML validator chrome extension to verify)

* My personalized information is displayed. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)


Respectfully,


Ivan Duranic
